Creative and passionate about art, I became intrigued with digital art and then 3D-modeling and game design/development.<br><br> As a blender and Unreal developer, I have had a lot of experience. I already have experience in this side of the platform, but I wanted to expand this to the cloud to allow all users to access high-end software and games on low-end devices. To do this, I have experience on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM cloud environments."
